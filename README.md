# Native Template Engine
Alternate templating service to replace Claromentis' god-awful XML abomination.

## Motivation
Considering the speed issues continually suffered by Claromentis' it's always struck me as odd that they would use a bloated XML-based templating engine. There is literally nothing that cannot be just as easily accomplished using vanilla PHP files.

XML is, by it's very nature, slow and resource intensive. This makes literally no sense.
